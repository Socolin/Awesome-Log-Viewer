settings.open.telemetry.console.description=The Console Log Processor parses logs from the output from the \
  <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet/blob/main/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.Console/ConsoleExporter.cs">.NET ConsoleExporter</a>. \
  The ConsoleExporter is not designed to be machine-readable, so the result is not optimal. \
  If you can use the Network Log Processor instead, you'll get the best result with it
settings.open.telemetry.network.name=Network
settings.open.telemetry.network.description=<p>The Network Log Processor starts an http server to catch the logs.</p>\
  <p>Logs can be redirected to this by setting the environment: <code>OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT</code> or others, \
  see <a href="https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter/">the documentation</a></p>\
  <p>The environment variable is automatically added for Java and .NET run configuration. \
  For the other run configuration you need to use a static port and add yourself the environment variable in the run configuration.
settings.open.telemetry.network.environment.variables.title=Environment Variables
settings.open.telemetry.network.environment.variables.comment=For Java and .NET run configuration only: those variables are injected \
  when the program starts. The string `<code>${SERVER_PORT}</code>` is replaced with the port of the http server.
